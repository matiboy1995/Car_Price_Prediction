# Model Card

See the [example Google model cards](https://modelcards.withgoogle.com/model-reports) for inspiration. 

## Model Description

**Input:**
Information about a used car. Specifically: 
-Region for sale in
-year
-make / manufacturer
-model
-fuel type
-odometer / millage
-title status
-transmission type
-state of sale
-long of location of sale
-lat of location of sale

**Output:** Describe the output(s) of your model
Prediction of the price of the used car: Price

**Model Architecture:** 
RandomForestRegressor from the sklearn package with the following hyper parameters:


UPDATE
para_grids = {
            "n_estimators" : [10,50,100],
            "max_features" : ["auto", "log2", "sqrt"],
            'max_depth' : [4,5,6,7,8,9,15],
            "bootstrap"    : [True, False]
        }


## Performance - TODO

Give a summary graph or metrics of how the model performs. Remember to include how you are measuring the performance and what data you analysed it on. 

## Limitations - TODO

There are a couple of limiations that should be noted:
-The model has no data for cars beyond the year of 25 years old, or newer than 2021. Cars outside this period are likely to have less accurate prices
-The data is approaching 2 years old, for makes and models that are more sensitive to age related depreciation the model will over report the price
-The model is trained on data about cars for sale in the USA, and will likely perform worse if international data is used.

## Trade-offs -TODO

Outline any trade-offs of your model, such as any circumstances where the model exhibits performance issues.
